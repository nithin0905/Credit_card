Predicting if the transactions are fraudulent or not.
We have used various machine learning and deep learning algorithms in this project such as KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, ANN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and XG Boost.
We have also implemented an association mining algorithm i.e. Apriori.
The accuracies we have obtained are as follows : 
1.D Tree    = 95.2%
2.R Forest  = 94.5%
3.KNN       = 90.5%
5.Logistic Regression = 85.9%
6.XG Boost  = 94.7%
